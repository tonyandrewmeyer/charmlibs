"""Sphinx fallback extension for per-library diataxis docs and change logs.

The ``diataxis_preprocessor.py`` script (run by ``just docs``) copies library
docs into the Sphinx source tree and generates ``_lib-*.md`` include files.

This extension provides a fallback: if any of those include files don't exist
— either because the preprocessor wasn't run, or because no libraries have docs
for a given category — it writes empty versions so that the ``{include}``
directives in the category index pages resolve without errors.
