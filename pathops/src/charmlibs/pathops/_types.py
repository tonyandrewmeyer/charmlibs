class PathProtocol(typing.Protocol):
    """The protocol implemented by :class:`ContainerPath` and :class:`LocalPath`.

    Use this class in type annotations where either :class:`ContainerPath` or
    :class:`LocalPath` is acceptable. This will result in both correct type checking
    and useful autocompletions.

    While using a union type will also give correct type checking results, it provides less
    useful autocompletions, as most editors will autocomplete methods and attributes that *any*
    of the union members have, rather than only those that *all* of the union members have.

    :class:`str` follows the :mod:`pathlib` convention and returns the string representation of
    the path. :class:`ContainerPath` return the string representation of the path in the remote
    filesystem. The string representation is suitable for use with system calls (on the correct
    local or remote system) and Pebble layers.

    Comparison methods compare by path. A :class:`ContainerPath` is only comparable to another
    object if it is also a :class:`ContainerPath` on the same :class:`ops.Container`. If this is
    not the case, then equality is ``False`` and other comparisons are :class:`NotImplemented`.

    Protocol implementers are hashable.

    .. warning::
        User implementations of ``PathProtocol`` are not covered by this package's semantic
        versioning promise.

        The semantic versioning of this package reflects the runtime use of :class:`ContainerPath`
        and :class:`LocalPath`. ``PathProtocol`` is always updated to reflect the latest changes to
        :class:`ContainerPath` and :class:`LocalPath`.

        ``PathProtocol`` will always be a valid type annotation for :class:`ContainerPath`,
        :class:`LocalPath`, and :class:`pathlib.PosixPath` objects. However, user implementations
        of ``PathProtocol`` may experience type checking breakage on minor version bumps of this
        package.

# doesn't seem worth supporting until (if) ContainerPath gets relative paths
#
# when we have relative paths, it will be meaningful to support the following:
# def __truediv__(self, key: str | os.PathLike[str] | Self) -> Self: ...
# def __rtruediv__(self, key: str | os.PathLike[str] | Self) -> Self: ...
# `ContainerPath / (str or pathlib.Path)`, or `(str or pathlib.Path) / containerPath`
# will result in a new ContainerPath with the same container.
# `ContainerPath / ContainerPath` is an error if the containers are not the same,
# otherwise it too results in a new ContainerPath with the same container.

# def __fspath__(self) -> str: ...
# we don't want ContainerPath to be os.PathLike

# def __bytes__(self) -> bytes: ...
# we don't want ContainerPath to be mistakenly used like a pathlib.Path

# URIs
# as_uri / from_uri are LocalPath-only (no sensible container-URI scheme):
#   LocalPath.from_uri is implemented as a classmethod delegating to pathlib on 3.13+,
#   with a urllib.parse polyfill on 3.10-3.12. Not in the protocol.
# def as_uri(self) -> str: ...  -- not implemented (confusing for ContainerPath)

# def is_reserved(self) -> bool: ...
# this will always return False with a PosixPath. Since we assume a Linux container
# so let's just drop it from the protocol for now

# def full_match(self, pattern: str, * case_sensitive: bool = False) -> bool: ...
# 3.13+
# not part of the protocol but may eventually be provided on ContainerPath
# to ease compatibility with pathlib.Path on 3.13+

# def relative_to(self, other: _StrPath, /) -> Self: ...
# this produces relative paths, which we shouldn't be using in any code designed to
# be compatible with both machines and containers, since pebble will error on any
# relative paths at runtime -- if users want to work with relative paths, I think
# they should explicitly work with a PurePath rather than a ContainerPath, and then
# construct the ContainerPath when they have the absolute path they need
#
# Python 3.12 deprecates the below signature, to be dropped in 3.14
# def relative_to(self, *other: _StrPath) -> Self: ...
# to ease future compatibility, we'd just drop support for the old signature
# from the protocol now if it was included
#
# Python 3.12 further modifies the signature with an additional keyword argument
# def relative_to(self, other: _StrPath, walk_up: bool = False) -> Self: ...
# this would not part of the protocol but could eventually be provided on
# ContainerPath to ease compatibility with pathlib.Path on 3.12+ if we someday
# support relative paths

# def is_relative_to(self, other: _StrPath) -> Self: ...  # 3.9+
# not part of protocol but can be provided on ContainerPath implementation
# to ease compatibility with pathlib.Path on 3.9+

# def with_stem(self, stem: str) -> Self: ...  # 3.9+
# not part of protocol but can be provided on ContainerPath implementation
# to ease compatibility with pathlib.Path on 3.9+
# could be added to the protocol if we're happy for LocalPath to double as backports

# def with_segments(self, *pathsegments: _StrPath) -> Self: ...
# required for 3.12+ subclassing machinery
# not part of the protocol (otherwise LocalPath would have to backport it)
# but it is a useful method -- given a ContainerPath with some container,
# you can make another path with the same container cleanly, so it'll be implemented
# on ContainerPath

# @property
# def drive(self) -> str: ...
# will always be '' for Posix -- maybe drop it from the protocol
# so users get more useful autocompletions?

# @property
# def root(self) -> str: ...
# potentially error prone -- ContainerPath.root / Path('foo') is not a ContainerPath

# @property
# def anchor(self) -> str: ...
# this is drive + root

# relative paths #
##################

# OPINION: we shouldn't support relative paths in v1 (if ever)
#
# if we support relative paths, we'd need to implicitly call absolute before every
# call that goes to pebble, and it's not clear whether it's a good idea to implement
# cwd, which absolute would depend on -- we'd have to pebble exec cwd, which wouldn't
# work in certain images (bare rocks)
#
# I think it would be fine for v1 to only support absolute paths, raising an error
# on file operations with relative paths

# the following methods would require us to either hardcode cwd or use a pebble.exec
# def cwd
# typically /root in container
# do we need to query this each time? can we hardcode it?
# def absolute
# interpret relative to cwd

# the following methods would require us to either hardcode home or use a pebble.exec
# def home
# typically /root in container
# do we need to query this each time? can we hardcode it?
# def expanduser
# '~' in parts becomes self.home
