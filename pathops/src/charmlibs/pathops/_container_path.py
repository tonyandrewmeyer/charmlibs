    The following examples are all equivalent::

    :class:`str` follows the :mod:`pathlib` convention and returns the string representation of
    the path. :class:`ContainerPath` return the string representation of the path in the remote
    filesystem. The string representation is suitable for use with system calls (on the correct
    local or remote system) and Pebble layers.

    Comparison methods compare by path. A :class:`ContainerPath` is only comparable to another
    object if it is also a :class:`ContainerPath` on the same :class:`ops.Container`. If this is
    not the case, then equality is ``False`` and other comparisons are :class:`NotImplemented`.

    Args:
        \*parts: components of the path, like :class:`pathlib.Path` constructor.
        container: used to communicate with the workload container. Required.
