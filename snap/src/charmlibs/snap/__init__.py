"""Opinionated library for performing snap operations, targeted at use in charm code.

Use :func:`ensure_installed` to ensure that a snap is installed, optionally on a specific
channel or revision.

Manually manage snap installation with :func:`install`, :func:`refresh`, and :func:`remove`.
Use :func:`list_one` to query the current state of an installed snap.

Also manage:

- Automatic refreshes with :func:`hold` and :func:`unhold`.
- Services with :func:`start`, :func:`stop`, and :func:`restart`.
- Config with :func:`get`, :func:`get_one`, :func:`set`, and :func:`unset`.
- Connections between snaps with :func:`connect` and :func:`disconnect`.
- Application aliases with :func:`alias` and :func:`unalias`.

Exceptions
----------

All errors raised due to interactions with the snapd API are subclasses of :class:`Error`.
Callers may trigger regular Python exceptions (e.g. :class:`ValueError`) when passing
invalid arguments to library functions.

All functions will raise a :class:`APIError` (or a subclass) if snapd returns an error response.
Functions will raise specific subclasses where possible to allow callers to handle logical errors.
Check the documentation for each function for details on which exceptions it may raise. A
function's documented errors are the ones it can report specifically: a plain :class:`APIError`,
or one of the transport errors below, is possible for any call.

Separately from the :class:`APIError` hierarchy (but inheriting from :class:`Error`),
the library may also raise the following exceptions:

A :class:`TimeoutError` indicates that snapd did not respond to a request in time. The library
does not retry a request that timed out: the timeout is generous, and already covers the retries
snapd itself makes against the store within a single request. The failure may still be transient,
due to the snap store infrastructure being under load, so callers may catch this error to layer
their own retry logic on top, or report a transient failure to the user.

A :class:`ConnectionError` indicates that snapd could not be reached at all, and may require user
action. The library briefly retries read-only requests, since snapd may be restarting as part of
a snap operation, but not requests that change state, since it cannot tell whether snapd received
them. :class:`SocketNotFoundError`, a subclass raised when the snapd socket does not exist, is
never retried: it usually means snapd is not installed on the system.

A :class:`BadResponseError` is raised if the snapd API returns a response the library does not
understand. Callers will not be able to resolve this error directly, and should report it to the
library maintainers. Its message includes what snapd sent that the library could not read, so an
uncaught traceback carries everything the report needs.
