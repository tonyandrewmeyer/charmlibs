# Get with keys=None returns the entire config, following the CLI (get_all is unnecessary).
# Reading a single value is get_one, defined below in terms of this function.
def get(snap: str, keys: str | Iterable[str] | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Get snap configuration.

    Args:
        snap: The name of the snap to read configuration from.
        keys: Configuration keys to read, as a single key or an iterable of keys. Nested options
            may be accessed with dotted notation, for example ``'server.port'``. If ``None``, the
            full config is returned as a nested dict. If an empty iterable, an empty dict is
            returned if the snap is installed.

    Returns:
        A dict mapping each requested key to its configured value. If all keys are requested
        (keys=None), the entire config is returned as a nested dict (empty if the snap has no
        configuration). If no keys are requested (keys=[]), an empty dict is returned if the snap
        is installed. Each dotted key queried is returned as a top-level entry. A single key
        passed as a bare string is no different from passing it in a list: the result is still a
        dict, so use :func:`get_one` to read one value without unwrapping it yourself.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the snap name is empty, blank, or is not a single path segment, or if a
            key is empty, blank, or contains a comma or surrounding whitespace.
        NotInstalledError: if the snap is not installed. Never raised for ``system`` or ``core``,
            whose configuration is served whether or not the core snap is installed.
        OptionNotFoundError: if a requested key has no value stored in the snap's configuration.
            Snap configuration is schemaless, so snapd does not distinguish between a key the
            snap doesn't recognise, a key that was never set, and a key that was unset. Any
            defaults a snap applies internally are invisible here unless its configure hook has
            stored them with ``snapctl set``.
        BadResponseError: if snapd answers with something other than a configuration mapping.
