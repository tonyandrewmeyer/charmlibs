"""Functional tests for connect/disconnect against the system snap, core present and absent.

snapd's ``CoreSnapdSystemMapper.RemapSnapFromRequest`` renames ``'core'`` and ``'system'`` to
``'snapd'`` at request time (overlord/ifacestate/helpers.go), before the daemon's installed-snap
check, and the snapd snap hosts the implicit system slots. So connect/disconnect targeting the
system snap -- by auto-resolution (``None``), or explicitly as ``'snapd'``, ``'core'``, or
``'system'`` -- works whether or not the core snap is installed.

Unlike conf, the interfaces library needs no special-casing for this: it performs no installed
checks of its own, and snapd's request-time remap resolves the alias to the always-present snapd
snap. The ``core_snap`` fixture runs every test in both states -- core installed and core absent
-- to prove the core-absent case really is served rather than only appearing to work because core
happened to be present.

Destructive: removes and reinstalls the core snap within its own fixture. Run only where the core
snap is disposable, as in CI containers. The test snap declares ``base: core24`` so it survives
core removal.
