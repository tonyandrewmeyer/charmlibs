    snap -- connecting an interface to it, for instance.

    Images normally hold auto-refresh already: GitHub's ubuntu runner images run
    `snap set system refresh.hold=<build date + 60 days>` in configure-snap.sh. The catch is that
    the hold is system (core snap) configuration, so this suite deletes it whenever it removes
    the core snap -- and the refresh it was holding back has been due since the image was built,
    so snapd starts one within seconds. That is why remove_core re-applies the hold rather than
    the suite setting it once and trusting it to stay.

    Nothing here depends on the image having held anything: the hold can be set whether or not
    the core snap is installed, since snapd serves the system configuration namespace either way.
