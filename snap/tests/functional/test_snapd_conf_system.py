"""Functional tests for system configuration via _snapd_conf: get/set/unset on 'system'.

snapd's conf endpoints treat 'system' as an alias for the 'core' snap and serve system
configuration whether or not the core snap is installed. The `core_snap` fixture runs every
test here in both states -- core installed and core absent -- because the absent state is where
get()'s installed-snap probe must be skipped: /v2/snaps/system always 404s and /v2/snaps/core
404s with no core snap, so probing would turn working calls into _NotFoundError.

This module is destructive to stored system configuration: removing the core snap deletes it
(snapd treats core's config like any other snap's; options snapd maintains itself, such as
seed.loaded, are re-mirrored on the next snapd restart). Tests therefore never preserve
pre-existing system options -- run this only where system configuration is disposable, as in
CI containers. The one exception is the auto-refresh hold: removing core wipes the runner
image's hold along with everything else, so remove_core puts one back (see
conftest.hold_auto_refresh for why that matters).

Ordering: the module needs no special ordering relative to other modules. It removes and
restores the core snap within its own fixture, no other module depends on system configuration,
and any snap a module needs is (re)installed via ensure_installed_store.
