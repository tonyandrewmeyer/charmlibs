# Agent instructions for charmlibs

## Overview

`charmlibs` is a monorepo of Python libraries for Juju charms.

**Key concepts:**

- **Juju** — Canonical's open-source orchestration engine. Deploys and manages applications on Kubernetes and bare-metal/VM clouds.
- **Charm** — a Python program that uses the [ops](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/ops/) framework to respond to Juju lifecycle events and manage a workload. Charms can be Kubernetes-based (using [Pebble](https://ubuntu.com/docs/pebble/) to manage container processes) or machine-based.
- **Juju relation** — a named connection between two charms, backed by shared key-value stores called *databags*. Relations are how charms communicate and exchange structured configuration.
- **Charm library** — a reusable Python package that charm authors import. All libraries in this repo are distributed as Python packages on PyPI (not Charmhub-hosted single-file modules, which are a legacy distribution method).

**Two library categories:**

| Category | Namespace | Example package | Import |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| General | `charmlibs` | `charmlibs-pathops` | `from charmlibs import pathops` |
| Interface | `charmlibs.interfaces` | `charmlibs-interfaces-tls-certificates` | `from charmlibs.interfaces import tls_certificates` |

General libraries live at the repo root (e.g. `pathops/`). Interface libraries live under `interfaces/` (for example, `interfaces/tls-certificates/`).

```

## Development workflow

### Prerequisites

`uv` and `just` are required. Verify they're available before proceeding:

```bash
uv --version && just --version
```

If either is missing, they can be installed like this:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic astral-uv   # installs uv
uv tool install rust-just               # installs just (once uv is available)
```

Run `just` or `just help` from anywhere in the repo to see all available commands. All `just` commands execute from the repo root regardless of where they're invoked.


### Adding a new library

Run `just init` to create a new general library, or `just init --interface` for a new interface library.
We recommend following the [tutorial](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs/tutorial) to learn how to add your library to the `charmlibs` monorepo.
If you're migrating a library that was published elsewhere, read the [how-to guide for migrating an existing library to this repository](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs/how-to/migrate/).
See the pull request templates for [writing a new library](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/adding-a-new-library.md) and [migrating an existing library](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/migrating-a-library.md) for checklists.

### Inner loop

The command you'll run most often is:

```bash
just check <package>
```

This runs `just lint <package>`, `just unit <package>`, and `just docs html <package>`. **Run this before every commit on the affected package.**

The `<package>` argument is the path from the repo root, e.g. `pathops` or `interfaces/tls-certificates`.

### Command reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just check <package>` | Lint + unit tests + docs (the standard pre-commit check) |
| `just lint <package>` | ruff + codespell + pyright |
| `just fast-lint [path]` | ruff only, across the whole repo or a specific path |
| `just format [package]` | Auto-fix ruff and formatting errors |
| `just static <package>` | pyright only |
| `just unit <package>` | Run unit tests |
| `just functional <package>` | Run functional tests (may need external software available, or to be run with sudo -- and note that this probably indicates a test that's destructive to the local environment (e.g. adding or removing packages)). **Do not run functional tests directly on the host.** Use Workshop instead (see below). |
| `just pack-k8s <package>` | Pack K8s test charm(s) for integration tests, running the libraries `tests/integration/pack.sh` script with environment variables set |
| `just pack-machine <package>` | Pack machine test charm(s) for integration tests, as above |
| `just integration-k8s <package>` | Run Juju integration tests, excluding `pytest.mark.machine_only` tests |
| `just integration-machine <package>` | Run Juju integration tests against machine, excluding `pytest.mark.k8s_only` tests |
| `just docs html [packages]` | Build docs (including reference docs for all packages by default, or named ones -- run `just docs html -` to exclude all package reference docs (faster when working on docs only) |
| `just docs` | Alias for `just docs html` |
| `just add <package> <dep>` | Add a dependency to a library |
| `just init` | Scaffold a new general library |
| `just init --interface` | Scaffold a new interface library |

Extra arguments to `just unit`, `just functional`, and `just integration-*` are passed through to pytest:

```bash
just unit pathops -x -k test_copy   # stop on first failure, filter by name
```

### Adding dependencies

**Always use `just add <package> <dep>` instead of calling `uv add` directly.** This applies repo-level version constraints from `test-requirements.txt`, which is necessary to keep the lockfile consistent:

```bash
just add pathops 'pydantic>=2'
just add interfaces/tls-certificates --requirements my-requirements.txt
```

## Test types

| Type | Command | What it tests | External requirements |
|------|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Unit | `just unit <package>` | Logic with mocked externals | None |
| Functional | `just functional <package>` | Interaction with real external processes (not Juju) | Varies (for example, pebble, sudo) |
| Integration | `just integration-k8s/machine <package>` | Library in a real Juju deployment | charmcraft + Juju controller |

A test type is only executed if the corresponding `tests/` subdirectory exists. Remove a directory to skip that test type entirely.

Read more: [types of tests in the charmlibs monorepo](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs/explanation/charmlibs-tests/).

### Running functional tests with Workshop

Functional tests often require `sudo` and may be destructive to the local environment (e.g. installing or removing system packages). **Never run functional tests directly on the host machine.** Always use [Workshop](https://snapcraft.io/workshop) to run them in an isolated container:

```bash
workshop exec resolute -- sudo just functional <package>    # Ubuntu 26.04
workshop exec noble -- sudo just functional <package>       # Ubuntu 24.04
workshop exec jammy -- sudo just functional <package>       # Ubuntu 22.04
```

Workshop configs are defined in `.workshop/`. Extra pytest flags are passed through to `just functional` (and on to pytest):

```bash
workshop exec noble -- sudo just functional snap -x -k test_install
```

## Commit and PR conventions

**PRs are squash-merged.** The PR title becomes the single commit message on `main`. Branch commit messages are for local reference, and should follow conventional commits for clarity.

PR titles must follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). When a PR affects a single library, use the distribution package name without the leading `charmlibs-` as the scope:

```
feat(pathops): add copytree and rmtree
fix(apt): handle multiarch package names correctly
chore(interfaces-tls-certificates): update to Pydantic v2
docs: improve tutorial for adding integration tests
```

**One PR should normally touch only one library.** The CI uses changed files to determine which packages to test and, on merge, which packages to publish.

### Versioning

- Libraries use semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
- Dev versions (`X.Y.Z.devN`) are excluded from release CI — safe for in-progress work.
- When bumping to a non-dev version, you **must** also update `CHANGELOG.md`. CI will block the merge otherwise.
- The CI automatically publishes to PyPI on merge when a non-dev version bump is detected.

## Package anatomy

A typical general library looks like this:

```
pathops/
├── src/charmlibs/pathops/
│   ├── __init__.py         # Exports public API; module docstring appears in reference docs
│   ├── _pathops.py         # Private implementation module(s)
│   └── _version.py         # __version__ string (auto-generated)
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   │   ├── conftest.py
│   │   └── test_*.py
│   ├── functional/
│   │   ├── setup.sh        # Sourced before tests (for example, start pebble)
│   │   ├── teardown.sh     # Sourced after tests (for example, kill pebble)
│   │   └── test_*.py
│   └── integration/
│       ├── pack.sh         # Script to pack test charms
│       ├── conftest.py     # Juju fixtures (jubilant)
│       ├── test_*.py
│       └── charms/         # Test charm source
├── pyproject.toml          # Package metadata, dependencies, tool config
├── uv.lock                 # Locked dependencies — commit this
├── README.md
└── CHANGELOG.md            # Must be updated before each release
```

The source uses a namespace package structure: `src/charmlibs/<name>/`. Public API is exported from `__init__.py` via `__all__`. Implementation lives in private submodules (prefixed with `_`). The module docstring in `__init__.py` appears as the top-level description in the generated reference docs.

## Interface libraries

Interface libraries manage the structured data that charms exchange over a Juju relation databag. Key differences from general libraries:

- Live under `interfaces/<interface-name>/`, named exactly as the interface name appears in `charmcraft.yaml`.
- Source under `src/charmlibs/interfaces/<interface_name>/`.
- Usually include a `testing/` subdirectory with a separate `charmlibs-interfaces-<name>-testing` package. This provides `relation_for_provider()` and `relation_for_requirer()` helpers for charm unit tests.
- Typically have unit and integration tests but no functional tests (all meaningful interaction is through Juju).
- Use `just init --interface` to scaffold.

## Documentation

Reference docs are auto-generated from Python docstrings via Sphinx autodoc. The docs source lives in `.docs/`. Build reference docs for a specific package with:

```bash
just docs html pathops
```

This is also run as part of `just check`. The full docs site (all packages) is built with `just docs`.

When writing or editing docstrings in `__init__.py` or other public modules, remember they appear verbatim in the published reference at [canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs). Keep them informative for library users, not implementation notes.

Don't use block quotes (`>`) for "Read more", "See also", or similar cross-reference sections. Instead, use bare text like `Read more: {ref}\`some-page\`` or, for two links, a comma-separated list or, for three or more links a bulleted list. For example:

```
Read more: {ref}`how-to-customize-integration-tests`

Read more: {ref}`charm-libs-charmhub-hosted`, {ref}`Charmcraft | Manage libraries <charmcraft:manage-libraries>`
```

### Migrating a library's docs

To bring an existing library's tutorials, how-to guides, and explanations into the monorepo, follow the **Migrate your library's docs** section of [How to migrate to the charmlibs monorepo](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs/how-to/migrate/). In short:

- For Charmhub-hosted docs, download each Discourse topic with `uv run .scripts/import-discourse-docs.py <discourse-url> <output-file>`, choosing a diataxis category (and so an output path) for each.
- Then edit the imported pages to fit charmlibs conventions, following [How to add docs to a library](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs/how-to/add-library-docs/).

There is no `reference` docs category — reference docs are generated from docstrings.

Note that this should only apply to documentation for library users -- general charm documentation should be hosted elsewhere.

## Common pitfalls

- **Don't call `uv add` directly** — use `just add <package> <dep>` to respect repo-level constraints.
- **Don't bump the package you're working on to a non-dev version without updating `CHANGELOG.md`** — CI will block the merge.
- **Making changes to multiple libraries in the same PR** — the CI matrix runs per changed package, and review requirements are determined by `CODEOWNERS`.
- **Don't add unnecessary features or refactor code beyond what's asked** — this is a multi-team monorepo with careful versioning; unintended public API changes require major version bumps.
