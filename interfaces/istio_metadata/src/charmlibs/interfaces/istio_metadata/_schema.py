"""Schema models for the istio_metadata interface.

This module is the source of truth for the databag wire format of the
``istio_metadata`` interface, and is symlinked from
``interface/v0/schema.py`` so it can be discovered as the canonical schema
on Charmhub.

Its only third-party dependency is Pydantic.
