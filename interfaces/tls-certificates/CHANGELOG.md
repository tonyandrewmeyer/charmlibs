# 1.10.1 - 25 August 2026

Fix `Mode.APP_AND_UNIT` requirers raising `RelationDataAccessError` on every non-leader unit. The library read the requirer's own application databag regardless of leadership, so once the leader had written its application certificate request, no other unit could complete a hook -- taking the unit scope down with the application one. Non-leaders now load the unit scope only, which is all they can act on: they can reach neither the application private key nor the application certificate secrets.

# 1.10.0 - 13 July 2026

Allow providers to advertise their certificate server's capabilities (`ProviderCapabilities`) in relation data, and let requirers read them via `get_provider_capabilities()` or by passing a callable `certificate_requests` that shapes requests from the advertised capabilities. Additive and backwards compatible.

# 1.9.0 - 6 July 2026

Store the `Mode.APP` private key under a new secret label and automatically migrate keys created by older versions (including pre-existing unit-owned keys) to an app-owned secret. The key material is preserved, so certificates are not regenerated on upgrade.

# 1.8.3 - 5 June 2026

Add a safety net to ensure expiring certificates are renewed even if the charm fails to trigger the renewal process.

# 1.8.2 - 3 June 2026

Update the library to cache the `private_key`.

# 1.8.1 - 27 February 2025

Cleanup secrets when relation is removed.

# 1.8.0 - 24 February 2025

Introduce the import_private_key public function to allow requirers to dynamically import an external public key.

# 1.7.0 - 18 February 2025

Introduce the APP_AND_UNIT mode so requirers can request both APP and UNIT certificates using one integration.

# 1.6.1 - 05 February 2025

Make `CertificateRequestAttributes` hashable to prevent unnecessary recreation of certificate requests in relation data.

# 1.6.0 - 27 January 2025

Add a safety net to ensure renewing expiring certificates.

# 1.5.0 - 27 January 2025

Add a public helper function to get the ID of the lib generated private key secret.

# 1.4.0 - 20 January 2025

Add a helper function in TLSCertificatesProvidesV4 to get the ProviderCertificateError objects from the relation data.

# 1.3.0 - 17 December 2025

Introduce the error field in relation data and specify error codes.

# 1.2.0 - 05 December 2025

Adding missing **hash**() functions.

# 1.1.0 - 27 November 2025

Importing changes from 4.26 version of the lib on Charmhub and releasing.

# 1.0.0.post2 - 19 November 2025

Correct docs URL in README.md.

# 1.0.0.post1 - 13 October 2025

Correct interface name in docs.

# 1.0.0.post0 - 7 October 2025

Fix docs link in readme.

# 1.0.0 - 2 October 2025
